In this moment of national crisis, Emperor Meiji placed a priceless Imperial secret in the Dragon Box, locked it, and hid it in a temple far from the palace. Only two people knew how to open the box: Meiji and the box?s sadistic constructor, Ogawa. Both died without telling a soul what was inside, or how to open it.Since then, the Imperial family has held a clandestine contest to open the box every twelve years, in the Year of the Dragon. The Dragon Box is devilishly difficult, filled with tricks, booDownload by traps, poisons, and mind-bending twists. Every puzzle master who has attempted to open it has died in the process.But Brink is not any </p>
